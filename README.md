# Matt Gillooly's tweaks to [Joe Ferris' Config Files](https://github.com/jferris/config_files)

a.k.a. dot files

## Install

Clone this repository, change into the cloned directory, and run:

```bash
./install.sh
```

This will create symlinks for all config files in your home directory. You can
safely run this file multiple times to update.

## Scripts

Some of the aliases and vim shortcuts use these scripts:

http://github.com/jferris/scripts

Just clone that repository and add it to your PATH.
